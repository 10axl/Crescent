This plugin aims to eradicate cheating from servers by making cheating not significantly advantageous enough for players.

Crescent is still under development but hopes to be ready for use soon.

Thank you for showing interest in the project! :)

We used to have a Discord server, but I'm not going to have too much time to maintain it, so unfortunately I had to delete it. It may return.

Suggestions can be sent to me on Discord at Awesome90#4116

# Features

- Open source. Anyone can contribute.
- Extremely configurable.

- Mathematics used to try to predict what a normal user should do in a scenario. This is then compared with what the user actually does to attempt to determine whether they are cheating or not.

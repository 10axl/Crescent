# Crescent

This plugin aims to eradicate cheating from servers by making cheating not significantly advantageous enough for players.

Crescent is still under development but hopes to be ready for use soon.

Thank you for showing interest in the project! :)

# Features

- Open source. Anyone can contribute.
- Extremely configurable.
- Learns from previous cheaters. If a player is marked as a cheater, then data will be stored about their behaviour. In the future, this data will be compared to the current data of players in order to determine whether they are cheating.
- Multiple checks. This ensures a higher degree of accuracy.
- Mathematics used to try to predict what a normal user should do in a scenario. This is then compared with what the user actually does to attempt to determine whether they are cheating or not.
